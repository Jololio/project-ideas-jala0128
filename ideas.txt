PROJECT IDEAS:

1) An app that lets you search up restaurants nearby and add them to a list that will auto pick one from that last and show you
all the information (Directions, address, phone, etc)

2) An app that behaves like spotify or soundcloud, allowing you to make a playlist and add music
to that playlist and play them back

3) An app that behaves like Amazon, or any other online retailer where a user can shop for products and add them to a cart
 
4) An app that behaves like Twitter/Facebook, where a user is able to make posts to a social media board

5) A to-do app that allows a user to input activities, homework, work projects, or any other to-do list type items in the order that
they want to complete them in and displays what activity is to be done first on login
